# Project Description
The purpose of this project is to create a walking autonomous quadruped that will walk towards a specified colored object. The quadruped will then use a magnetic robotic arm to pick up the colored object and carry it to a different place. The project will take advantage of camera vision to measure the number of pixels on the screen to decide where to navigate. For locomotion, gaits are used to help the robot move its limbs in a balanced motion. Low-level and high-level programming are separated between a Raspberry Pi 5 and an Arduino Uno. The separation allows different software developers to work and test asynchronously. As well as allowing less stress on the individual components.
